SFX

It makes no difference what size you have the sound files.  Sound effects are played once and the music is played on loop.

Sprites -> Enemies

enemy_ships.png 300x150
5 rows and 10 columns, all 30x30
The first row contains only three sprites for a single spaceship animation.
The following four rows contain 10 sprites for various spaceship animations.
That means part of this sprite sheet is not used (the top row between columns 4-10).

explosion_stray.png 750x30, all 30x30
This is one row with 25 different sprites to show a single explosion animation for the stray enemy ship that occasionally appears on top.
